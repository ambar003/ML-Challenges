Solution approach:-
  In this question we have 4 features sign height,width,ratio and angle.Detected Camera and target variable are encoded with LabelEncoder.

1- since sign width and height and correlated variable and width is more correlated with target variable.

2- I used different models like linear regression, k nearest neighbours ,xgboost and random forest.out of these models random forest is giving me higher accuracy.

3- I tried transforming features but it didn't improve any accuracy.

4- I ensemble both xgboost model and random forest model which gives me 99.90204 accuracy. following are models i built and their accuracy-

In this following model i used all features:-

(Random forest model)rfr = 99.89930
(Xgboost model)xgb = 99.89731
(k nearest neighbour)knn = 99.70648
(ensembling random forest and xgboost)eclf = 99.89819 

In this i removed one of the vaiables sign width or height:-

rfr without sign width = 99.90133
rfr without sign height = 99.90149
xgb without sign width = 99.90016 
xgb without sign height = 99.89931 
xgb+rf = 99.90204 

found some incorrect data points but i was not able to create any new feature from available features. Its because of may be i dont have any domain knowledge in this 
field :( .
