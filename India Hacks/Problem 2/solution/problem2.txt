solution approach:-
1- From dow variable i created dummy variables for every week day. similarly for tod,cities,genres.

2- i created title variable which are as follows :
title_sum,title_count and top 400 titles.

3- from cities i also created cities_sum and cities_count and similary for tod,dow.

4-i created top 20 cities which give me good accuracy.

top 50 cities + top 100 titles = 0.81361
top 100 cities + top 100 titles = 0.81358
top 20 cities(removing unknown) + top 400 titles = 0.81581

point 1- what i found is that in cities new delhi,mumbai ,bengaluru ,chennai etc have higher watching hours and higher frequency. Its may be because in these cities 
people have internet available and they saw shows at hotstar mostly cricket.(age group-18-25)

point 2- age group 25-40 mostly have subscription and saw romantic, drama, teen and reality shows like koffee with karan.these age-group watch shows mostly at evening about 5-7
pm and at night 9-11:30 pm.

point 3- there are 35 genres in which cricket, drama, reality shows and teen shows genre are most popular genre.
